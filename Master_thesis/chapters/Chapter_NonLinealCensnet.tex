\section{Introduction to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a class of neural networks where physical laws are incorporated into the learning process, guiding the model to respect these constraints. Unlike traditional neural networks, where the loss function is typically based on the discrepancy between predicted and actual data, PINNs introduce additional terms in the loss function that penalize the model for deviating from known physical principles.

In this case, the physical constraints are derived from the gas balance and the Weymouth equations, which describe the flow and pressure behavior within the gas transportation network. These constraints are integrated into our neural network as additional loss terms. Specifically, we define two layers within the network: one that calculates the error in gas balance and another that calculates the error in the Weymouth equation. The outputs of these layers are then used to adjust the network's predictions, ensuring that they adhere to the physical laws governing the system.

The inclusion of these physics-informed layers allows the network to achieve better generalization, as it is not only trained on the data but also guided by the underlying physical laws. This approach can be seen as a specialized form of regularization, where the model is penalized if its predictions do not satisfy the physical constraints. The overall loss function can be expressed as:


\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\Theta) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}}(\Theta) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{weymouth}}(\Theta),     
    \label{eq:PINN_basic_definition}
\end{equation}


% \[
% \mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\Theta) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}}(\Theta) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{weymouth}}(\Theta),
% \]

where \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\Theta) \) represents the traditional data-driven loss, \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}}(\Theta) \) is the loss associated with the gas balance constraint, and \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{weymouth}}(\Theta) \) is the loss associated with the Weymouth equation constraint. The parameters \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) control the importance of each physical constraint in the learning process.


In this section, we incorporate the physical laws of the gas balance and Weymouth equations to guide the model's training process. The gas balance equation, represented by \cref{eq:gas_balance}, ensures that the flow into and out of each node in the network adheres to the principle of mass conservation. The Weymouth equation, referred to as \cref{eq:weymouth_cons}, establishes a relationship between the flow and pressure differences across pipelines. These two equations will be the foundation for introducing physics-based constraints into the neural network, ensuring the model's predictions respect the physical behavior of gas flow within the system.


\section{Experimental Setup}

In this chapter, we build upon the experimental setup outlined in \cref{sec:LinealCensnet_ExperimentalSetup}, maintaining the same general approach while incorporating new elements that account for the physics of the natural gas system. The samples are generated using the nonlinear natural gas network optimization model from \cref{cap:optimization_mpcc}. In this process, a power-interconnected system was considered, but since this study focuses on the gas system, the power system remained constant without any variation. As in the previous setup, noise is introduced into the base values of two gas networks: a small-scale test network of 8 nodes and the more extensive Colombian natural gas transportation system. The noise levels, ranging from 5\% to 25\%, simulate various operating conditions, providing diverse training data.

While the GNN-based model from \cref{cap:lienal-censnet} was designed as a fast alternative to the optimization-based model, this chapter introduces physics-informed elements into the network architecture. Specifically, the model now includes loss terms based on the gas balance and Weymouth equations to ensure the predicted flows comply with the physical laws governing gas transportation. These constraints, integrated through additional layers in the model, guide the learning process, penalizing deviations from the gas balance equation (\cref{eq:gas_balance}) and the Weymouth equation (\cref{eq:weymouth_cons}). The modified model maintains the same structural components, such as input channels, convolutional layers, and loss functions for node and edge predictions, with the difference that the balance equation and the Weymouth equation are now considered loss functions.

\section{Results}


In this section, we present the results of the proposed model, which now incorporates physical constraints from the natural gas system. The focus remains on the relationship between the predicted outputs and the actual observed values, evaluating the model's performance across the 8-node test network and the Colombian natural gas transportation system. By incorporating physics-based constraints, the goal is to assess the model's ability to predict critical parameters under various operational conditions while ensuring that the physical laws governing gas flow are respected.

\subsection{Case Study I: 8-node Network}



In this chapter, we begin with experiments that account for both node and edge losses, as it was found that considering only the node loss did not produce adequate results. The best parameters identified for this experiment were $N channels=25$, $N layers =4$, and $N dense = 11$. These settings yielded a total loss of 6.816, with a node loss of 2.794 and an edge loss of 4.021.

The results corresponding to the nodes, shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_base_node}, exhibit a similar behavior to that observed in 
\cref{fig:results_dummy_node_base_f}, demonstrating that the model accurately captures the injection pattern at the nodes. The correlation between the actual and predicted values is also strong, as indicated by an $R^2$ of 0.983.

Edge flows show some variation, as seen in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_base_f}, mainly when predicting the flows through the first pipeline connected to the injection field, where slight deviations from the actual flow values were observed. However, the model performed well overall, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.983 for the edge flows. While the first pipeline presents some prediction challenges, the accuracy in predicting flows across the rest of the pipelines remains high, demonstrating the model's ability to handle the complexity of gas transportation in this nonlinear system.

The second part of this experiment involves the additional loss associated with the gas balance, building upon the previous setup that considered both node and edge losses. The hyperparameter optimization yielded the best parameters: $N channels =61$, $N layers =2$, and $N dense=2$. These settings resulted in a total loss of 10.041, with a node loss of 2.850, an edge loss of 6.414, and a balance loss of 0.776.

The prediction behavior at the nodes, as shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_node_base_f_bal}, remained consistent with the results obtained in the previous experiment, where the balance loss was not included. The model accurately captured the gas injection pattern, with an $R^2$ of 0.983 for node flow predictions, identical to the earlier case.

Similarly, the prediction of edge flows, shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_edge_base_f_bal}, followed the same general trend as before, although a slight decrease in accuracy was observed, reflected by an $R^2$ of 0.973. While this represents a minor reduction in performance compared to the previous experiment, the model still demonstrated a strong ability to predict gas flows through the edges, maintaining a high level of accuracy.
