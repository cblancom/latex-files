\section{Introduction to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)}

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a class of neural networks where physical laws are incorporated into the learning process, guiding the model to respect these constraints. Unlike traditional neural networks, where the loss function is typically based on the discrepancy between predicted and actual data, PINNs introduce additional terms in the loss function that penalize the model for deviating from known physical principles.

In this case, the physical constraints are derived from the gas balance and the Weymouth equations, which describe the flow and pressure behavior within the gas transportation network. These constraints are integrated into our neural network as additional loss terms. Specifically, we define two layers within the network: one that calculates the error in gas balance and another that calculates the error in the Weymouth equation. The outputs of these layers are then used to adjust the network's predictions, ensuring that they adhere to the physical laws governing the system.

The inclusion of these physics-informed layers allows the network to achieve better generalization, as it is not only trained on the data but also guided by the underlying physical laws. This approach can be seen as a specialized form of regularization, where the model is penalized if its predictions do not satisfy the physical constraints. The overall loss function can be expressed as:


\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\Theta) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}}(\Theta) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{weymouth}}(\Theta),     
    \label{eq:PINN_basic_definition}
\end{equation}


% \[
% \mathcal{L}(\Theta) = \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\Theta) + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}}(\Theta) + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{weymouth}}(\Theta),
% \]

where \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{data}}(\Theta) \) represents the traditional data-driven loss, \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{balance}}(\Theta) \) is the loss associated with the gas balance constraint, and \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{weymouth}}(\Theta) \) is the loss associated with the Weymouth equation constraint. The parameters \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) control the importance of each physical constraint in the learning process.


In this section, we incorporate the physical laws of the gas balance and Weymouth equations to guide the model's training process. The gas balance equation, represented by \cref{eq:gas_balance}, ensures that the flow into and out of each node in the network adheres to the principle of mass conservation. The Weymouth equation, referred to as \cref{eq:weymouth_cons}, establishes a relationship between the flow and pressure differences across pipelines. These two equations will be the foundation for introducing physics-based constraints into the neural network, ensuring the model's predictions respect the physical behavior of gas flow within the system.


\section{Experimental Setup}

In this chapter, we build upon the experimental setup outlined in \cref{sec:LinealCensnet_ExperimentalSetup}, maintaining the same general approach while incorporating new elements that account for the physics of the natural gas system. The samples are generated using the nonlinear natural gas network optimization model from \cref{cap:optimization_mpcc}. In this process, a power-interconnected system was considered, but since this study focuses on the gas system, the power system remained constant without any variation. As in the previous setup, noise is introduced into the base values of two gas networks: a small-scale test network of 8 nodes and the more extensive Colombian natural gas transportation system. The noise levels, ranging from 5\% to 25\%, simulate various operating conditions, providing diverse training data.

While the GNN-based model from \cref{cap:lienal-censnet} was designed as a fast alternative to the optimization-based model, this chapter introduces physics-informed elements into the network architecture. Specifically, the model now includes loss terms based on the gas balance and Weymouth equations to ensure the predicted flows comply with the physical laws governing gas transportation. These constraints, integrated through additional layers in the model, guide the learning process, penalizing deviations from the gas balance equation (\cref{eq:gas_balance}) and the Weymouth equation (\cref{eq:weymouth_cons}). The modified model maintains the same structural components, such as input channels, convolutional layers, and loss functions for node and edge predictions, with the difference that the balance equation and the Weymouth equation are now considered loss functions.

\section{Results}


In this section, we present the results of the proposed model, which now incorporates physical constraints from the natural gas system. The focus remains on the relationship between the predicted outputs and the actual observed values, evaluating the model's performance across the 8-node test network and the Colombian natural gas transportation system. By incorporating physics-based constraints, the goal is to assess the model's ability to predict critical parameters under various operational conditions while ensuring that the physical laws governing gas flow are respected.

\subsection{Case Study I: 8-node Network}



In this chapter, we begin with experiments that account for both node and edge losses, as it was found that considering only the node loss did not produce adequate results. The best parameters identified for this experiment were $N channels=25$, $N layers =4$, and $N dense = 11$. These settings yielded a total loss of 6.816, with a node loss of 2.794 and an edge loss of 4.021.

The results corresponding to the nodes, shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_base_node}, exhibit a similar behavior to that observed in 
\cref{fig:results_dummy_node_base_f}, demonstrating that the model accurately captures the injection pattern at the nodes. The correlation between the actual and predicted values is also strong, as indicated by an $R^2$ of 0.983.

Edge flows show some variation, as seen in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_base_f}, mainly when predicting the flows through the first pipeline connected to the injection field, where slight deviations from the actual flow values were observed. However, the model performed well overall, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.983 for the edge flows. While the first pipeline presents some prediction challenges, the accuracy in predicting flows across the rest of the pipelines remains high, demonstrating the model's ability to handle the complexity of gas transportation in this nonlinear system.

    \caption{Model results using only the loss associated with nodal flow predictions in the 8-node network.}
    \label{fig:dummy_base_results}
\end{figure}


The second part of this experiment involves the additional loss associated with the gas balance, building upon the previous setup that considered both node and edge losses. The hyperparameter optimization yielded the best parameters: $N channels =61$, $N layers =2$, and $N dense=2$. These settings resulted in a total loss of 10.041, with a node loss of 2.850, an edge loss of 6.414, and a balance loss of 0.776.

The prediction behavior at the nodes, as shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_node_base_f_bal}, remained consistent with the results obtained in the previous experiment, where the balance loss was not included. The model accurately captured the gas injection pattern, with an $R^2$ of 0.983 for node flow predictions, identical to the earlier case.

Similarly, the prediction of edge flows, shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_edge_base_f_bal}, followed the same general trend as before, although a slight decrease in accuracy was observed, reflected by an $R^2$ of 0.973. While this represents a minor reduction in performance compared to the previous experiment, the model still demonstrated a strong ability to predict gas flows through the edges, maintaining a high level of accuracy.

    \caption{Model results using only the loss associated with nodal flow predictions in the 8-node network.}
    \label{fig:dummy_base_results}
\end{figure}


In the following part of this experiment, we incorporated losses associated with node and edge flows, the gas balance, and the Weymouth equation. The hyperparameter optimization for this setup yielded the following best parameters: $N channels=17$, $N layers =1$, and $N dense =4$. These settings resulted in a total loss of 20.670, with the individual losses being a node loss of 3.000, an edge loss of 11.354, a balance loss of 2.724, and a Weymouth equation loss of 3.592.

As shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_node_base_f_bal_wey}, the behavior of the node flow predictions remained consistent with the previous experiments, with an $R^2$ of 0.983. The model continued to accurately capture the gas injection patterns at the nodes.

However, the prediction accuracy for edge flows showed a notable deterioration, as seen in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_edge_base_f_bal_wey}. The $R^2$ value for edge flow predictions dropped to 0.952. This decrease in performance is primarily due to the difficulties encountered in predicting flows along edges 1, 2, 6, and 7. Edges 1 and 2 correspond to pipelines that are part of a closed path in the network, while edges 6 and 7 correspond to compressors. These complexities in the network configuration likely contributed to the reduction in predictive accuracy for these specific edges.

    \caption{Model results using only the loss associated with nodal flow predictions in the 8-node network.}
    \label{fig:dummy_base_results}
\end{figure}



In the subsequent experiment, the losses associated with node flows and the physical equations—namely, the gas balance and the Weymouth equation—were considered. The hyperparameter optimization process resulted in the best parameters being $N channels=18$, $N layers=1$, and $N dense=5$. These settings led to a total loss of 10.270, with a node loss of 3.976, a balance loss of 4.747, and a Weymouth equation loss of 1.547.

The prediction at the nodes, shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_node_base_bal_wey}, remained largely consistent with previous experiments, though there was a slight decrease in accuracy, with the $R^2$ value dropping to 0.976. This minor reduction indicates that the model continues to perform well in predicting gas injection patterns at the nodes.

However, the prediction accuracy for edge flows, as seen in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_edge_base_bal_wey}, experienced another decline. The $R^2$ value dropped to 0.899, reflecting increased difficulties in predicting flows through the compressors and the pipeline connected to the injection field.

    \caption{Model results using only the loss associated with nodal flow predictions in the 8-node network.}
    \label{fig:dummy_base_results}
\end{figure}



In the final stage of the experiment, only the losses associated with nodal flows and the Weymouth equation were considered. The optimal hyperparameters for this configuration were $ N channels=22$, $ N layers=1$, and $ N dense=19$. These parameters yielded a total loss of 2.798, entirely attributed to the node loss, while the Weymouth loss was effectively zero.

The node predictions, as depicted in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_node_base_wey}, continued to perform similarly to most of the previous tests, with an $R^2$ of 0.983, indicating consistent and accurate predictions of gas injection patterns at the nodes.

However, the edge predictions, shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_dummy_edge_base_wey}, were significantly off target in this case. The model struggled to generalize edge flows, resulting in a drastically negative $R^2$ of -2.32, signaling a complete failure in predicting gas flows through the network's edges.

\caption{Comparison of mean and standard deviation values for nodal flows, edge flows, nodal balance, and prediction time between IPOPT and GNN across different loss configurations.

\label{tab:base_nl_dummy_results_formatted}
\end{table}




The \cref{tab:lineal_col_results} presents a comparison between the IPOPT optimization model and the GNN-based model across four experiments, varying in the inclusion of nodal loss (N) and edge loss (E). The comparison focuses on nodal flows, edge flows, nodal balance, and prediction time, with the mean and standard deviation calculated from 100 random experiments.

The IPOPT optimizer serves as the benchmark in this analysis. It achieves a mean nodal flow value of \( 4.81 \pm 12.81 \), a mean edge flow value of \( 23.18 \pm 15.25 \), and a balance value of \( -0.024 \pm 0.308 \). The prediction time for this model is \( 0.99 \pm 0.53 \) seconds. These results set the baseline for comparison against the GNN-based models.

In the first GNN experiment, which only considers nodal loss, the model predicts a nodal flow value of \( 4.81 \pm 12.64 \), closely matching the IPOPT benchmark. However, its edge flow value is considerably lower, at \( 0.42 \pm 2.36 \), reflecting the absence of an edge loss in this experiment. The balance value exhibits high variability at \( -0.016 \pm 17.448 \), indicating the model's challenge in balancing flows without edge loss. Notably, the GNN significantly reduces prediction time, averaging \( 0.13 \pm 0.03 \) seconds, demonstrating its efficiency compared to the IPOPT model.

The nodal flow prediction remains consistent in the second GNN experiment, which incorporates both nodal and edge losses, with a mean of \( 4.92 \pm 13.02 \). The edge flow prediction improves significantly to \( 22.96 \pm 15.36 \), aligning closely with the IPOPT benchmark. The balance value also improves, reducing variability with a mean of \( 0.095 \pm 1.678 \), and the prediction time remains efficient at \( 0.14 \pm 0.05 \) seconds.

When balance loss is introduced alongside nodal and edge losses in the third experiment, the nodal flow value remains stable at \( 4.83 \pm 12.65 \). In comparison, the edge flow prediction improves to \( 23.20 \pm 14.92 \), closely matching the IPOPT results. The balance value becomes more consistent, with a mean of \( 0.004 \pm 0.845 \), indicating the model's enhanced ability to maintain network balance. The prediction time remains unaffected at \( 0.14 \pm 0.05 \) seconds.

In the final GNN experiment, which includes the Weymouth loss along with nodal, edge, and balance losses, the nodal flow value slightly decreases to \( 4.76 \pm 12.51 \), and the edge flow value remains close to the benchmark at \( 22.93 \pm 14.64 \). The balance value, at \( -0.070 \pm 1.665 \), suggests a slight deviation from perfect balance, though still within acceptable variability. The prediction time remains efficient at \( 0.14 \pm 0.05 \) seconds, underscoring the GNN's capability to handle increasingly complex models without significantly increasing computational time.


\subsubsection{Stochastic Analysis}
To study the uncertainty inherent in the network further, we first computed the joint probability density functions (PDFs) for the variables used as inputs to the network. For training, each node was assigned five inputs (numbered 0 to 4), corresponding respectively to the lower limit of gas injection capacity, the upper limit of gas injection capacity, the demanded flow, the lower limit of pressure, and the upper limit of pressure. Since the lower limits are permanently fixed at zero, these two variables were excluded from the analysis. Although the training data were initially sampled from a uniform distribution, only the successfully converged samples during the optimization process were retained. Consequently, the resulting PDFs do not exhibit a uniform distribution; instead, they display a variety of distribution shapes.

    \caption{}\label{fig:joint_distributions_input_input}
\end{figure}
     


Figure~\ref{fig:joint_distributions_input_input} shows the first group of joint distributions identified in this study. These distributions are characterized by two distinct modes, which likely indicate two different operational regimes of the system. Notably, none of these distributions correspond to any pair that includes node 1 (the input node of the first compressor) or node 5 (the node immediately preceding one of the demand nodes).

















\subsection{Case Study II: 63-node Network (Colombia)}


This section addresses the second case study, focusing on the Colombian natural gas network. As in the previous cases, this analysis explores various configurations of loss functionals to evaluate the predictive performance of the GNN-based model. The first experiment examines the model's predictive capabilities when incorporating node and edge losses.


This experiment used optimized hyperparameters, with \( N_{\text{channels}} = 21 \), \( N_{\text{layers}} = 5 \), and \( N_{\text{dense}} = 4 \), which were selected to enhance the model's performance. The experiment yielded a total loss of \( 267,600 \), encompassing node and edge losses, along with a calculated balance loss. Specifically, the node loss reached \( 17,537 \), while the edge loss was considerably higher at \( 250,063 \). Additionally, a balance loss of \( 338,729 \) was recorded. Notably, the balance loss was calculated to assess network consistency but was not incorporated into the model's cost function during training; instead, it serves as an independent evaluation metric. 

The GNN-based model's predictive accuracy in this experiment was quantified using \( R^2 \) metrics, and the results are shown in \cref{fig:col_base_f_results_non_lineal}. The nodal predictions exhibited high accuracy, with an \( R^2 \) score of \( 0.993 \) in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_node_base_f}, indicating that the model closely approximates the observed nodal flow values. Similarly, the edge predictions achieved an \( R^2 \) score of \( 0.963 \), demonstrating robust performance in predicting edge flows. This last value can be seen in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_edge_base_f}.

\end{figure}


The second experiment evaluated the GNN-based model, focusing on losses associated with nodes and balance. Using the optimized hyperparameters \( N_{\text{channels}} = 49 \), \( N_{\text{layers}} = 5 \), and \( N_{\text{dense}} = 2 \), the model yielded a total loss of \( 24,888 \). This loss value includes a node loss of \( 17,019 \), a calculated edge loss of \( 2,912.201 \), and a balance loss of \( 7,868 \). In this experiment, only the node and balance losses were included in the model's cost function, while the edge loss was computed independently to assess prediction accuracy for edge flows.

The predictive accuracy, evaluated using \( R^2 \) metrics, yielded \( R^2 = 0.993 \) for nodal predictions and \( R^2 = 0.569 \) for edge predictions, as shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_node_base_bal} and \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_edge_base_bal}. The scatterplot in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_node_base_bal} illustrates the accuracy of nodal predictions, with predicted values aligning closely to the true values. In contrast, the scatterplot in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_edge_base_bal} reveals less consistency in edge predictions, likely due to the exclusion of edge loss from the cost function. Although a general linear trend is observable between predicted and true values in this scatterplot, a notable number of inaccurately predicted values diminish the overall \( R^2 \), impacting the edge loss and prediction accuracy.

The third experiment evaluated the GNN-based model's predictive capabilities by incorporating losses associated with nodes, edges, and balance. With the optimized hyperparameters \( N_{\text{channels}} = 20 \), \( N_{\text{layers}} = 5 \), and \( N_{\text{dense}} = 2 \), the model achieved a total loss of \( 347,647 \), including a node loss of \( 37,684 \), an edge loss of \( 264,187 \), and a balance loss of \( 45,776 \). This experiment integrated all three losses into the model's cost function, allowing a more comprehensive assessment of its predictive performance.

The predictive accuracy was quantified by \( R^2 \) values of \( 0.984 \) and \( 0.961 \) for nodes and edges, respectively, as shown in \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_node_base_f_bal} and \cref{fig:results_nonlineal_col_edge_base_f_bal}. In these scatterplots, the predictions demonstrate a clearer alignment with the true values, with both graphs illustrating shapes more similar to straight lines, which indicates improved model performance in capturing the underlying patterns of nodal and edge flows.

This third experiment marks the final test conducted in this study. Attempts to include the Weymouth loss were hindered by significant computational complexity, preventing the acquisition of reliable results for the model when considering the Weymouth function loss. Therefore, further tests were not feasible within the current scope.

The \cref{tab:base_nl_dummy_results_formatted} provides a comparison between the IPOPT optimization model and the GNN-based model across four experiments that incorporate different combinations of nodal (N), edge (E), and balance (B) losses. The results focus on nodal flows, edge flows, nodal balance, and prediction time, with mean and standard deviation values.

In this table, the IPOPT model serves as the baseline. It achieves a nodal flow mean of \( 11.32 \pm 48.89 \), an edge flow mean of \( 63.38 \pm 83.11 \), and a balance value mean of \( -2.18 \pm 29.78 \). The prediction time for this benchmark model is \( 13.65 \pm 2.86 \) seconds, providing a standard for comparison with GNN-based models.

The first GNN experiment considers only the nodal loss. It produces a nodal flow mean of \( 11.22 \pm 49.03 \), closely aligning with the IPOPT nodal flow. The edge flow mean, at \( 62.73 \pm 81.99 \), is also similar to IPOPT's results. The balance value mean of \( -2.28 \pm 25.48 \) shows moderate variability, while the GNN's prediction time is notably faster, at \( 0.15 \pm 0.04 \) seconds.

In the second GNN experiment, both nodal and edge losses are incorporated. The nodal flow prediction mean slightly increases to \( 12.47 \pm 48.89 \), while the edge flow mean shows a more significant increase, reaching \( 88.32 \pm 73.55 \). The balance value improves in consistency, with a mean of \( -1.03 \pm 1.90 \), and the prediction time remains low at \( 0.15 \pm 0.05 \) seconds, indicating efficient computation.

The third GNN experiment includes nodal, edge, and balance losses. Here, the nodal flow means it is \( 12.33 \pm 48.64 \), and the edge flow means returns to a closer alignment with IPOPT at \( 63.06 \pm 81.32 \). The balance value stabilizes, reaching \( -1.17 \pm 7.38 \), while the prediction time remains consistent at \( 0.15 \pm 0.04 \) seconds.

This table illustrates the GNN model's capability to maintain accurate predictions and achieve lower computational time than IPOPT, especially when incorporating more loss components.



\section{Discussion and conclusions}


This chapter's first set of experiments provides insights into the model's capability to handle gas network predictions with various loss function combinations. Including node and edge losses in the initial experiment demonstrated the model's capacity to accurately capture node behavior, as evidenced by a high $R^2$ value of 0.983 for nodal flow predictions. This result indicates the model's ability to learn injection patterns at the nodes, even under nonlinear system conditions.

Incorporating the gas balance loss in subsequent experiments maintained the accuracy of nodal predictions, with no notable change in the $R^2$ for node flows. However, the slight reduction in the $R^2$ for edge flows to 0.973 suggests that while the gas balance constraint improved overall network consistency, it introduced additional complexity that slightly affected edge prediction performance. This outcome highlights a trade-off between accurate node predictions and balanced edge flows, indicating robust model performance with some sensitivity to changes in loss function configurations.

Further exploration of the model's response to including the Weymouth equation loss introduced more pronounced effects, particularly on edge flow predictions. The decline in $R^2$ to 0.952 for edge flows indicates increased difficulty in accurately modeling flow through specific network paths, particularly in regions with closed loops or compressor installations. This outcome underscores the challenge of incorporating multiple nonlinear physical constraints, especially in complex configurations.

In the experiment where only the Weymouth equation and node losses were considered, the model maintained a high $R^2$ for nodal flows. However, the extremely low $R^2$ for edge predictions, reaching negative values, suggests the model struggled to generalize edge flows effectively when isolated from balancing and edge losses. This finding reinforces the need for a comprehensive loss framework incorporating node and edge dynamics to ensure robust network performance, highlighting the challenges of predicting edge flows under limited constraints.

Comparing the results from \cref{cap:lienal-censnet} with those in \cref{cap:non_linealcensnet} reveals that the addition of physical constraints in \cref{cap:non_linealcensnet} improves model performance, particularly in terms of balancing accuracy.

The losses presented in \cref{cap:lienal-censnet} (Table \ref{tab:lineal_dummy_results}) reflect initial configurations with only nodal and edge losses. In these setups, while nodal and edge values show reasonable consistency with the APOPT optimizer, the balance values exhibit higher variability, especially in the GNN configurations. For example, when both nodal and edge losses are applied, the GNN model in \cref{cap:lienal-censnet} produces a balance error of \(-5.711 \pm 16.854\), which differs significantly from the APOPT optimizer's near-zero balance error (\(-0.001 \pm 0.038\)). This difference indicates that the simpler GNN models in \cref{cap:lienal-censnet} lack additional constraints to replicate the physical conditions accurately.

In \cref{cap:non_linealcensnet}, adding constraints related to balance and the Weymouth equation (Table \ref{tab:base_nl_dummy_results_formatted}) leads to improved balance accuracy. For instance, the GNN model with nodal, edge, and balance losses achieves a balance error of \(0.004 \pm 0.845\), considerably lower and more consistent with the IPOPT optimizer. This improvement demonstrates how adding balance constraints reduces variability and error associated with balance. Additionally, GNN configurations that include balance and Weymouth constraints (i.e., N, E, B, W) sustain this balance improvement while closely aligning with APOPT, which results in nodal and edge values.

% Overall, the experiments in \cref{cap:non_linealcensnet} show that by introducing these physical constraints, the GNN model achieves lower balance errors and maintains high-quality responses across all evaluated metrics. This finding confirms that incorporating additional constraints in the model configuration leads to more accurate and physically consistent results, bringing model performance closer to optimizer methods.



In the second experiment, the performance of the GNN-based model was evaluated in three configurations with different combinations of loss functions applied to the Colombian natural gas network. For each configuration, it was possible to consider the nodal losses, the losses associated with the edges, and the gas balance dede. The analysis provides information on the trade-offs and improvements observed with each additional loss function.

The first configuration of the GNN model, which incorporated nodal and edge losses, achieved high accuracy in predicting nodal flows with an $R^2$ score of $0.993$ while maintaining an edge prediction $R^2$ of $0.963$. This configuration showed strong performance in nodal predictions,  suggesting that focusing on this loss combination allows a good approximation of nodal flows in the system. The balance loss value, calculated independently, highlighted minimal deviation, indicating that nodal accuracy alone could achieve network consistency for this setup. These results underscore the model's capacity to generalize nodal flow predictions while capturing nodal behaviors, making this configuration efficient for applications where nodal flow prediction is prioritized.

The second configuration evaluated the impact of including nodal and balance losses in the model's cost function. The results demonstrated a stable nodal prediction performance, with an $R^2$ score consistent at $0.993$, while edge predictions dropped to an $R^2$ of $0.569$. This reduction in edge prediction accuracy suggests that excluding edge loss from the cost function introduced inconsistencies in the edge flows, as reflected in the decreased $R^2$ value. Despite the moderate accuracy in edge flow predictions, the balance loss value remained relatively low, indicating stable nodal balance but highlighting a trade-off when optimizing only nodal and balance aspects. 

% This configuration suggests that while balance loss contributes to network consistency, it may only sufficiently capture edge flow dynamics with edge-specific optimization.

In the third configuration, the GNN model included all three loss types: nodal, edge, and balance. This approach achieved a slightly lower $R^2$ of $0.984$ for nodal predictions but improved the edge prediction accuracy, yielding an $R^2$ of $0.961$. The overall alignment of predictions observed in the scatterplots suggests that incorporating all three loss functions enabled the model to more comprehensively capture the patterns of both nodal and edge flows. This approach demonstrated the most balanced trade-off between nodal and edge prediction accuracy, supporting the hypothesis that optimizing all three aspects simultaneously enhances the model's capacity to predict flows in the Colombian natural gas network. 


% These findings provide valuable insights into the effects of different loss function combinations on the predictive accuracy and computational efficiency of GNN models for natural gas networks. The results highlight the balance between optimizing nodal, edge, and balance losses to meet specific predictive requirements in network modeling.

Finally, the performance of the GNN-based model for the Colombian natural gas network is compared in two experimental configurations: Chapter 2 and Chapter 4. Each experiment considered nodal, edge, and balance loss combinations, assessing their effects on prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, due to high computational demands, the experiments in Chapter 4 did not include the Weymouth equation loss.

In Chapter 2 (Table \ref{tab:lineal_col_results}), the GNN-based model, when only the nodal loss was applied, achieved a Node Value of \(11.38 \pm 49.13\) and an Edge Value of \(0.91 \pm 1.26\), with a Balance Value of \(-2.19 \pm 58.56\). The model showed relatively high accuracy in nodal predictions and achieved minimal edge prediction errors, highlighting the model’s effectiveness in capturing nodal flows without explicitly optimizing for edge loss.

In Chapter 4 (Table \ref{tab:base_nl_dummy_results_formatted}), the experiments showed varied performance depending on the losses included:

1. In the configuration considering only nodal loss, the GNN achieved a Node Value of \(11.22 \pm 49.03\) and an Edge Value of \(62.73 \pm 81.99\), with a Balance Value of \(-2.28 \pm 25.48\). Compared to Chapter 2, this configuration demonstrated a higher edge error, suggesting that solely optimizing nodal loss did not generalize as effectively for edge predictions as observed previously.

2. When both nodal and edge losses were included, the GNN model’s Node Value increased to \(12.47 \pm 48.89\), with a significant rise in Edge Value error to \(88.32 \pm 73.55\). The Balance Value was reduced to \(-1.03 \pm 1.90\), indicating improved nodal balance but an unfavorable impact on edge prediction. This result diverges from Chapter 2, where the inclusion of edge loss contributed to more consistent results in both nodal and edge values.

3. In the configuration considering nodal, edge, and balance losses, the GNN model achieved a Node Value of \(12.33 \pm 48.64\), with an Edge Value of \(63.06 \pm 81.32\) and a Balance Value of \(-1.17 \pm 7.38\). This approach achieved better balance accuracy but did not markedly improve edge error over configurations excluding balance loss, contrasting with Chapter 2, where combined losses had more favorable outcomes.

Across both chapters, it is clear that optimizing for multiple loss functions introduces complexity, with varied impacts on nodal and edge prediction accuracy. The Chapter 4 results indicate that including balance and edge losses improves nodal balance but can lead to edge-accuracy trade-offs. Further optimization strategies or alternative methods may be required to balance all metrics.
